#What is the Boilerplate?
The "Boilerplate" is the most basic component of the LightSpeed VT platform and represents the global UI of the system. It may help to think of it as the "Page Template" of the system. The components of the Boilerplate are as follows:

* **"Hamburger Menu"**  
Can be hidden or shown by the user and contains links to most areas of the system. Intended to provide quick and convenient access for users.  

* **Page Header**  
Establishes branding and exposes crucial navigation elements and functionality throughout the system.

* **Page Background**  
Supports and enhances branding and adds visual interest throughout the system.

* **Page Body**  
Displays a distinct backdrop for page content and provides "cookie crumb" navigation functionality for sub-pages.

* **Page Footer**  
Provides links to less-often used areas of the system as well as legal information and additional branding opportunities (logos, etc)
