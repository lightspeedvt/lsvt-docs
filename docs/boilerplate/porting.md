#Porting Existing Themes
In order to minimize work when porting themes to the boilerplate, we've created a "starter kit" generator that will generate your `_theme.scss` file with values from any existing theme.

###Getting The Starter Kit
Simply log-in to a location that you'd like to port and follow these steps:

1. Visit the [starter-kit generator](http://vt.lightspeedvt.com/template/boilerplate/theme-starter.cfm)
2. Copy and paste the code into you `_theme.scss`
3. Run `grunt` and check it out!
