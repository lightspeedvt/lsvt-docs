#Writing Custom SCSS
If you're wanting to do something really special, we've provided a way for you to write your own SCSS (Sassy CSS) and have it included in your theme. Basically you just edit the file `_custom.scss` and it will override any defaults inside your theme.

###Naming Conventions
The boilerplate's HTML markup was built with [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) and [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) in mind, so it might be helpful to familiarize yourself first.

###Using Selectors
The included `index.html` file will help you to make sense of what's where and how you may be able to style things. Please note that you should NOT edit this file. It's only a snapshot of what's on the live site and changes will not effect anything but your local preview.
