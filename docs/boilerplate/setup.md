#One-Time Deal
Once you've successfully [installed the tools](boilerplate/install) you'll need to perform a few more steps in order to start building themes. These only need to be performed once and then you'll be good to go.

***

###Get on GitHub
The project files are hosted at GitHub, in order to access the repository you must be a member of the LightSpeed VT organization. Please contact an admin in order to get access.

***

###Clone the Project
Once you have access you can "clone" the following url to a folder on your local machine.
`https://github.com/lightspeedvt/boilerplate-css.git`

***

###Install the Required Modules  
There are a number of required tools that are not included in the project files. These can be easily downloaded and installed via the command-line tools that were installed previously.

In order to install them just open the terminal, switch to your project directory and issue the following commands:

1. `sudo npm install`
1. `bower install`

###Add the AWS Credentials  
The AWS credentials are stored in the file `aws-keys.json` which is not included in the project files for security purposes. Please contact an admin in order to get a copy and then place it at the project root.

###Become a Theme-building Superhero  
Congratulations, you should now be ready to start churning out themes! The best place to start is to go through the [tutorial](boilerplate/tutorial) and then read the [documentation](boilerplate/docs).
