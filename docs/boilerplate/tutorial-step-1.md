#Creating Your Branch
Themes are stored as "branches" in Git which allow for easy integration, updating and deployment. Once you've created your theme's branch you'll be able to work locally and "push" your changes to Github when finshed. This makes it easy to share themes with other designers and to keep a history of what's been changed by whom.

***

###Choosing a Name 
The name of your branch is important. The name you choose is used when publishing your theme to the web so make sure it is unique yet memorable. You can use LGIDs if you'd like, but remember that the name should be human readable and make sense.

| Good Name:    | Bad Name:              |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| theme/cardone | theme/theme-main-12953 |
