## Boilerplate Icons
A number of icons from the [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/) library are included with the boilerplate. These can be used on any page that implements the boilerplate, or they can be used standalone.

### Using the icons
In order to use an icon, simply add a `<span>` or give your element the class name `icon-` followed by the icon name you'd like to use. For a listing of the available icons see [this example.](http://codepen.io/lsvt-casey/pen/yxnaf)

You may have an instance where you'd like to use the icons on a page that does not contain the boilerplate. In order to use in your page, simply insert this html snippet:
```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='http://static.lightspeedvt.com/theme/shared/icons.css'>
```
